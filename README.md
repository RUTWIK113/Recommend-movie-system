## `Recommend A Movie - System`

```markdown

Interactively explore movie recommendations built with classic machine learning techniques and a lightweight front end.

## 📖 Overview

A simple yet powerful movie recommender that takes your favorite movies and suggests similar titles by calculating similarity across user ratings and movie features.

## 🚀 Features

- **Model-Based Recommendations**: Uses collaborative filtering (via MovieLens-style ratings) to compute user similarity and suggest movies.
- **Popularity and Similarity**: Blends overall popularity with personalized similarity metrics.
- **Interactive Interface**: Run `app.py` for a minimal Flask or CLI experience to get recommendations.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Analyze dataset, build models, explore RMSE and performance inside `Main.ipynb`.

## 📁 Repository Structure


movie\_recommender\_system/
├── Main.ipynb          # Exploratory Data Analysis + model development
├── main.py             # Script to fetch recommendations via console
├── app.py              # Simple Flask interface (optional UI)
└── dataset.csv         # Movies ratings dataset (MovieLens-style)



## 🛠 Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Chando0185/movie_recommender_system.git
cd movie_recommender_system
pip install -r requirements.txt  # scikit-learn, pandas, flask, etc.


## 🎯 Usage

* **Notebook**: Open `Main.ipynb`, run data analysis and model training.

* **Console**:

  ```bash
  python main.py


  Enter a movie ID or title to get top-5 suggestions.

* **Web App**:

  ```bash
  python app.py


  Navigate to `http://localhost:5000` to use the browser interface.

## 🎯 How It Works

1. **Data Load**: Uses `dataset.csv`, formatted similar to MovieLens.
2. **Preprocessing**: Cleans and filters user and movie rating matrices.
3. **Similarity Matrix**: Computes cosine similarity between users or movie vectors.
4. **Recommend**: Finds high-similarity users or top-rated movies to generate recommendations.

## 📈 Evaluation

* Evaluates using RMSE and MAE by splitting data into train/test.
* Optional visualizations included in the notebook.

## 🧩 Extending Project

* Integrate **content-based** or **hybrid filtering**
* Add **SVD / matrix factorization**, **autoencoders**
* Deploy via **Streamlit** or containerize with **Docker**
