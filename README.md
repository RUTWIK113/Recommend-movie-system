# 🎬 Recommend A Movie - System

A simple and effective movie recommendation engine that suggests similar movies based on user ratings and collaborative filtering techniques.

## 📌 Overview

This project implements a basic movie recommender system using user-based collaborative filtering. It leverages cosine similarity between user preferences to suggest movies that a user is likely to enjoy. The application includes a command-line interface and an optional Flask-based web interface for interacting with the system.

## 🧠 Features

- ✅ Collaborative Filtering using Cosine Similarity
- ✅ Movie rating-based recommendations
- ✅ CLI and Web interface (Flask)
- ✅ Performance evaluation (RMSE, MAE)
- ✅ Jupyter notebook for analysis and visualization

## ⚙️ Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Chando0185/movie_recommender_system.git
   cd movie_recommender_system
````

2. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## 🚀 Usage

### 🧪 Run the Jupyter Notebook

Open `Main.ipynb` to explore data preprocessing, similarity matrix computation, and model evaluation.

### 🖥️ Run CLI-based Recommender

```bash
python main.py
```

Enter the movie ID when prompted to receive recommendations.

### 🌐 Run the Web App (Flask)

```bash
python app.py
```

Visit `http://localhost:5000` in your browser to use the web interface.

## 📊 Evaluation

* The model evaluates recommendations using:

  * Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
  * Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
* These metrics help assess how well the system predicts unseen ratings.

## 🧩 Possible Improvements

* Add support for content-based recommendations
* Use SVD or Matrix Factorization (e.g., using Surprise or LightFM)
* Add persistent user data and authentication
* Deploy on Streamlit or Dockerize for better scalability

├── Main.ipynb          # Exploratory Data Analysis + model development
├── main.py             # Script to fetch recommendations via console
├── app.py              # Simple Flask interface (optional UI)
└── dataset.csv         # Movies ratings dataset (MovieLens-style)



## 🛠 Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Chando0185/movie_recommender_system.git
cd movie_recommender_system
pip install -r requirements.txt  # scikit-learn, pandas, flask, etc.


## 🎯 Usage

* **Notebook**: Open `Main.ipynb`, run data analysis and model training.

* **Console**:

  ```bash
  python main.py


  Enter a movie ID or title to get top-5 suggestions.

* **Web App**:

  ```bash
  python app.py


  Navigate to `http://localhost:5000` to use the browser interface.

## 🎯 How It Works

1. **Data Load**: Uses `dataset.csv`, formatted similar to MovieLens.
2. **Preprocessing**: Cleans and filters user and movie rating matrices.
3. **Similarity Matrix**: Computes cosine similarity between users or movie vectors.
4. **Recommend**: Finds high-similarity users or top-rated movies to generate recommendations.

## 📈 Evaluation

* Evaluates using RMSE and MAE by splitting data into train/test.
* Optional visualizations included in the notebook.

## 🧩 Extending Project

* Integrate **content-based** or **hybrid filtering**
* Add **SVD / matrix factorization**, **autoencoders**
* Deploy via **Streamlit** or containerize with **Docker**
